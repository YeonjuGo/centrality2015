==============
Here's a set of macros related to centrality for the Run2

1. trigger turn-on curve : triggerTurnOn.C
2. plot centrality object 1D and 2D with different event selection filter : filterDep1D_Eff.C, filterDep2D.C
3. event selection efficiency calculator : filterEffCalculator.C
4. HF tower filter with HYDJET and STARLIGHT for gen, reco, l1 : GetHFfraction.C, run_GetHFfraction.sh
5. plot centrality object 1D comparison between DATA and MC : compare_data_mc_1D.C
6. centrality calibration by fitting method : fit.C, fitAll.C, testFriend.C, makeCentrality.C
7. centrality calibration by the number of tower distribution method : make_nTower.C, draw_nTower.C
